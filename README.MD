# Masked-Face-Detection

Rain Prediction on self constructed dataset using ANN.

                                 How to get to our project

● Download the .ipynb file provided in the zip folder.

● Upload that ipynb file on that collab note book.

● Load the zipped dataset folder into the colab notebook.

● Create a new empty folder named “Dataset” as in order to unzip the folder and
extract all the data from that, all the dataset should be stored in a newly created
new empty folder named “Dataset”.

● You can see all the code in blocks and their results

● If you want to re-run the code then press ctrl+enter to run a particular block and
ctrl + F9 to run the whole colab notebook at once.

● Our project is on Face masked detection which detects masked faces.

● Try different classifiers if you want for better accuracy.

● Used different methods to increase the accuracy of the classifiers by using grid
search over different parameters to find the best parameter to be fitted in the
model.
